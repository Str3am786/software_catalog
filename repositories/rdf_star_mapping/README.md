## RDF-star mapping
The following files are needed to perform the transformation from the JSONs found by SOMEF and RDF-star. 

Files include:
- The config file used for morph-kgc (library used to do the mapping)
- The script used for transforming all repos
- The file obtained as a result (with all RDF files aggregated)

**NOTE** that the folder structure needed to run the script needs to be set up (all JSONs pointing to the right file, the config file, etc.).
